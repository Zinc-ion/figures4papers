  Load when the user is finalizing or creating matplotlib figures for academic
  publication—bars, trends, scatter, heatmaps, or multi-panel layouts—and needs
  this repository’s house style, print/vector export, or parity with figures4papers
  demos. Skip for interactive dashboards or web viz (Plotly, Altair, Bokeh),
  exploratory-only plots not headed to publication, dominant 3D or geographic
  mapping, or Illustrator/Figma-first infographic workflows.

# Scientific figure making

## When to load this skill

- Matplotlib figures for **papers, slides, or reports** that must match **this repo’s publication look** (fonts, palette, spines, legends, export).
- Requests involving **grouped bars, trend lines, heatmaps, multi-panel grids**, or **PDF/SVG/high-DPI** output in a scientific-figure context.
- References to **figures4papers** `figure_*` projects or “same style as the repo figures.”

## When not to load

- **Plotly, Altair, Bokeh**, or other interactive / web-first plotting.
- **EDA-only** plots where seaborn or pandas is enough until there is a publication target.
- Primary workflow is **3D, GIS**, or **non-matplotlib** tooling.
- **Illustrator / Figma–first** layout or infographic (not matplotlib data plots).
